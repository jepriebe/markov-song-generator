File defining set of words that cannot act as the final word on a line. Any words in this set found at the end of a line will be shifted to the next line, or removed if at the end of the text. Can be edited as desired (must be single words, no phrases). Categories don't matter and are simply suggestions. All words must be on a separate line and preceded by a '#' (no quotes).
